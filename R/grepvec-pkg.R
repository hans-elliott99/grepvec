#' grepvec package
#'
#' Use `grepvec` to search a vector of strings for matches in a vector
#' of regular expressions or fixed strings. R's native functions, like grep,
#' search for a single pattern in a vector of strings. To search for many
#' possible patterns across a string, some form of looping is required.
#' `grepvec` implements this in C so that it is faster than native R solutions.
