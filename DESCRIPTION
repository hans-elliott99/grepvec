Description: Use 'grepvec' to search a vector of strings for matches in a vector
  of regular expressions or sub-strings. R's native 'grep' functions search for
  a single pattern in a vector of strings. To search for many possible patterns
  across a string, some form of looping is required. 'grepvec' implements this
  in C so that it is much faster than native R solutions.
