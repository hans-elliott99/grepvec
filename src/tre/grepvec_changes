Changes to TRE for use in grepvec:

To use TRE as a regex library, the R developers made a number of changes to the TRE source code. See "R_changes" for their notes.  
The files were copied from the latest release of R, 4.3.3 (where tre is located at src/extra/tre).  

In addition to the R team's changes, a few more were made in the tre directory for use in the grepvec project:  
- R sets some definitions in ./src/gnuwin32/fixed/h that are used in their modifications of TRE, which have been added to tre-config.h, with some additional #includes as well.  
- The Makefile.in and Makefile.win files were from the tre directory as they are not needed.  
- In xmalloc.c: changed calls to function "abort" to call "Rf_error" to match R's error handling, and calls to "printf" to "Rprintf" - to silence warnings from R CMD check about calling entry points that may terminate R or write to stdout/stderr.  
- Removed dependency on R's "rlocale.h" header (included in tre-internal.h).
