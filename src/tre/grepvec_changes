Changes to TRE for use in grepvec:

To use TRE as a regex engine, the R developers made a number of changes to the TRE source code. See "R_changes" for their notes.
To use TRE in grepvec.c in a way that reflects R's use (to keep similarity to base::grep), the tre directory was copied from R's source code (from the source at src/extra/tre).

Starting from R's modified TRE library, a few changes were made in the tre directory for use in the grepvec project:  
- R sets some definitions in ./src/gnuwin32/fixed/h that are used in their modifications of TRE, which have been added to tre-config.h, with some additional #includes as well, which would be needed if TRE_WCHAR is defined.
    - The R developers define TRE_WCHAR and implement support for wide char (wchar_t) in order to support more encodings. Disabling for now since translating all chars to UTF8.  
    - Note that enabling wide char support slows down the program quite a bit on my machine.  
- removed the Makefile.in and Makefile.win files from the tre directory as they are not needed.  
- in xmalloc.c: changed calls to "abort" to "Rf_error" to match R's error handling and calls to "printf" to "Rprintf" - to silence warnings from R CMD check about calling entry points that may terminate R or write to stdout/stderr.
