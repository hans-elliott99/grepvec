## Search for a vector of patterns in a vector of strings

Use `grepvec` to find needles in haystacks.  

That is, search for each item in a vector of patterns (either regular expressions or fixed strings) across each item in a vector of strings.  
R's native 'grep' functions search for a single pattern in a vector of strings. To search for many possible patterns across a string or vector of strings, some form of looping is required. `grepvec` implements this in C so that it is more efficient than native R solutions.

## Examples

Please see vignettes/examples.md for more examples.

```{r}
library(grepvec)

grepvec(needles = c("some", "other", "string"),
        haystacks = c("some string 1", "another string"))

grepvec(c("^h", ".ell.", "ello$"), c("hello", "jelly"))

grepvec(c("^h", ".ell.", "ello$"), c("hello", "jelly"),
        value = TRUE)

grepvec(c("one", "possib", "many"),
        c("Some text which might possibly contain one of many keywords",
          "Another string, without many words",
          "A third impossibly boring string",
          "I'm done thinking of strings."),
        out = "haystacks",
        value = TRUE)

grepvec(letters, paste(letters, collapse = ""), value = TRUE)
grepvec(letters, paste(letters, collapse = ""), matchrule = "first", value = TRUE)
grepvec(letters, paste(letters, collapse = ""), matchrule = "last", value = TRUE)

x <- grepvec(letters[1:6], c("abc", "123"), out = "object")
setNames(grepvec::by_hay(x, value = TRUE), c("abc", "123"))
setNames(grepvec::by_ndl(x, value = TRUE), letters[1:6])
```



## Install
Since this package is not currently on CRAN, you can install it in R with `remotes::install_github("hans-elliott99/grepvec")`.  

For development you can, clone the repo and use `devtools::install`.

### Dependencies

There are no package dependencies, other than R's `base` package.  
For development, only `devtools` and its dependencies are needed.


## Development
This project is in development. I have used it in my own work for keyword-search related tasks, but it lacks testing by other users. If you find it useful please let me know, and let me know how I might improve it to better suit your needs. Thanks!



## Use Cases

The `grepvec` function provides a convenient way to search a vector of strings (haystacks) for multiple patterns (needles) at once, which is not directly supported by base R functions like grep, or by similair `stringr` functions.

While it's possible to combine multiple patterns into a single regular expression using the "|" operator, this can be difficult to manage for a large number of patterns. Further, it doesn't easily allow you to identify which specific patterns were matched, or how many.

Some potential use cases:  

- Text Analysis: If you're analyzing a corpus of text (like a collection of documents, tweets, or web pages), you might want to find occurrences of a list of specific key words or phrases. `grepvec` can be used to efficiently perform this task.

- Data Cleaning: When cleaning data, you often need to find and replace certain patterns. If you have a list of known errors or inconsistencies (like misspellings or alternative representations of the same value), you can use `grepvec` to identify these in your data.

- Others?
